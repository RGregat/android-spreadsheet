This is a spreadsheet for Android.  I began working on it in 2011, and 
have worked on it on and off since then.

Currently it can load CSV spreadsheets, XLS spreadsheets and XLSX 
spreadsheets.  I will push up functionality I already have written where 
it load ODS spreadsheets as well.

I have more functionality written that has not been pushed up yet.  This
includes being able to search through cells.  I also have functionality
to push up which loads all sheets of a spreadsheet, which use multiple
tabs on-screen.  The app can handle rows and columns of different sizes.

I also have functionality to save files, although I will work on that 
more before pushing it up.

There are a lot of little things that need to be done, some of which are 
already done and just need to be pushed up.  I wanted to get the code 
out there though.
